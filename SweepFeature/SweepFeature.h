  DESCRIPTION
  
  This is the first-level header file for the DLL. It declares the primary CWinApp
  object (that serves to initialize and close out the DLL). More impotantly, it contains
  the description of the COM Class Factory which is used by COM to start up this DLL
  and dole out objects from within it.
